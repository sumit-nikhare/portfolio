                <p class="body-text lg:w-2/3 lg:mx-auto">This case study focuses on designing a mobile application for conducting Digital Health Surveys under the Department of Health Services (DHS), Government of Maharashtra, with a special focus on the role of ASHA workers in collecting health data. The aim is to create a user-friendly mobile interface for field-level health workers that streamlines data collection and reporting.</p>

                    <p class="body-text">The current health survey process is inefficient due to paper-based systems or complicated digital interfaces that are not optimized for field conditions. ASHA workers face difficulties in submitting data in remote locations due to poor connectivity and outdated systems. This design project focuses on creating a mobile app that allows for offline data collection, easy usability, and error reduction, ensuring faster and more accurate health survey reporting.</p>

                <p class="section-header">Key Features</p>
                <p class="text-neutral-500">The key features of the DHS mobile application are designed to simplify data collection, improve accuracy, and ensure smooth operation even in areas with poor or no internet connectivity. These features aim to enhance the user experience for ASHA workers and Health Supervisors, enabling efficient and error-free health survey management.</p>

                <div class="grid grid-cols-1 gap-2">
                    <span class="section-sub-header">Survey Module</span>
                    <ol class="list-decimal list-outside pl-6 text-neutral-500">
                        <li>Guided Data Entry: A step-by-step approach to guide ASHA workers through different sections of the health survey. The forms are organized in a logical flow, allowing users to focus on one task at a time.</li>
                        <li>Context-Sensitive Forms: Depending on the survey type (maternal health, immunization, etc.), the app presents relevant questions and data fields. Dynamic fields adjust based on previous answers (e.g., if a mother reports a child’s illness, further details are requested).</li>
                        <li>Pre-filled Options: Common answers and dropdown menus reduce typing effort and speed up data entry. For example, names of local diseases, medications, and community programs can be preloaded.</li>
                        <li>Auto-save: The app saves progress as data is entered, ensuring no information is lost in case of interruptions.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                    <ol class="list-decimal list-outside pl-6 text-neutral-500">
                        <li>Offline Data Collection: This feature allows ASHA workers to complete surveys without an internet connection, which is crucial for remote areas with intermittent or no network coverage.</li>

                        <li>Local Storage: Data is stored securely on the device until an internet connection becomes available. The app encrypts data locally to ensure privacy and security.</li>

                        <li>Sync When Online: Once the ASHA worker connects to the internet, the app automatically uploads saved surveys and sends them to the central server without requiring manual intervention.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                        <li>ocalized Interface: The app supports multiple regional languages, allowing ASHA workers to operate in their preferred language. This is especially important for users in rural areas who may not be fluent in English or Hindi.</li>

                        <li>Language Switching: Users can switch between languages at any point within the app without losing progress, making it easier for workers from diverse linguistic backgrounds.</li>

                    <ol class="list-decimal list-outside pl-6 text-neutral-500">
                        <li>Real-time Validation: As data is entered, the app checks for common errors, such as missing fields, invalid entries (e.g., entering text in a number field), or inconsistent information (e.g., a mother’s age being younger than her child’s age). This feature reduces submission errors and ensures the integrity of the data.</li>

                        <li>Error Notifications: If the app detects an error during data entry, it provides immediate feedback and instructions on how to correct it. This prevents incorrect data from being submitted.</li>

                        <li>Data Completeness Check: Before submission, the app runs a completeness check to ensure all mandatory fields are filled. Workers are notified if any required information is missing.</li>

                        <li>Geotagged Data: ASHA workers can use location tagging to mark the geographical coordinates of survey locations. This is useful for health officials tracking outbreaks, vaccinations, or other regional health trends.</li>

                        <li>Proximity Alerts: The app can alert workers if they are near a community or household due for a health survey or follow-up. This feature helps ASHA workers plan their visits more efficiently.</li>

                <p>The user testing process played a crucial role in refining the Khushi Baby health application. By actively involving ASHA workers and ANMs throughout the design and development phases, we ensured that the application met their specific needs and preferences. The iterative feedback loop allowed us to make informed design decisions, resulting in a user-friendly and effective tool for improving maternal and child health outcomes in underserved communities.</p>
