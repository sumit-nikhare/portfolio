                <p>The user testing process played a crucial role in refining the Khushi Baby health application. By actively involving ASHA workers and ANMs throughout the design and development phases, we ensured that the application met their specific needs and preferences. The iterative feedback loop allowed us to make informed design decisions, resulting in a user-friendly and effective tool for improving maternal and child health outcomes in underserved communities.</p>
