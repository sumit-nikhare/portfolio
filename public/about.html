                        <p class="text-neutral-500">I’m Sumit, a UX/UI designer based in Jaipur, India.</p>

                        <p class="text-neutral-500">Design has always been my passion, driving me to immerse myself in user interfaces, graphic design, and front-end development over the past decade.</p>

                        <p class="text-neutral-500">My natural curiosity fuels my continuous exploration and investigation of new knowledge and skills. As a designer, I balance perfectionism with a love for discovering new design realms. My approach is characterized by an ongoing interplay between divergent and convergent thinking, blending artistic flair with scientific precision, and navigating the creative chaos while meticulously attending to details.</p>

                        <p class="text-neutral-500">Over the past 2.8 years, I have worked at three startups, where I gained valuable experience managing UI component libraries, building responsive websites, and developing Android/iOS applications. I contributed to adding features to existing platforms, encompassing everything from layout and structure to the creation of UI assets.</p>

                        <p class="text-neutral-500">Currently, I am a Senior UI/UX Designer at Khushibaby (NGO). My focus is on enhancing the UX of the existing CHIP application and integrating new programs into it. Additionally, I am working on new applications and dashboards for GoK (HWC) and GoM in partnership with the PATH team. My passion for new AI tools is growing, and I am exploring how to incorporate them into my workflow to improve efficiency and accelerate project delivery.</p>

                        <p class="text-neutral-500">I have honed my proficiency in fast-paced environments, managing complex projects, and meeting strict deadlines. Throughout my career, I've developed strong collaboration skills, working seamlessly with cross-functional partners such as product managers and engineers. My versatile experience, combined with my ability to connect with people, allows me to foster an optimal work environment for my team, ensuring we achieve our best results together.</p>
