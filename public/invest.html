                    <p class="body-text">The current system for channel partners (CPs) to manage property listings, client interactions, and commissions faces usability challenges. Complex workflows, a cumbersome CRM interface, and confusing commission tracking reduce CP efficiency. Additionally, offers and the Seal of Trust, which are essential for boosting sales and client credibility, are not easily accessible. A UI/UX redesign is needed to simplify navigation, improve CRM and CM usability, and enhance the visibility of key features, empowering CPs to manage clients and close deals more effectively.</p>
