                    <p class="body-text">Startups often face significant challenges in securing the funding they need to scale, while potential investors struggle to find emerging ventures that align with their interests and investment goals. The current landscape lacks a centralized, user-friendly platform that connects startups seeking funding with investors looking for new opportunities. Startups need a seamless way to present their ideas, progress, and funding requirements, while investors require an intuitive interface to discover, evaluate, and invest in promising ventures.</p>
                    <p class="body-text">The goal of this project is to design an app that bridges this gap, allowing startups to easily post their projects for potential investors to see, and enabling investors to browse, evaluate, and invest in various startups from a single platform. The design should focus on a streamlined user experience, transparency, and fostering trust between both parties.</p>

                    <p class="section-sub-header">Onboarding</p>
                    <p class="body-text">The onboarding process introduces users to the app’s purpose and functionality, guiding both startup founders and potential investors through tailored experiences. For founders, the onboarding highlights steps to post their startup, while for investors, it explains how to browse and evaluate startups for funding. The design must ensure clarity, reduce friction, and set expectations, using a combination of visuals and short descriptions to ease users into the platform. Features like social login and quick-start guides could help reduce onboarding time and improve user retention.</p>

                    <p class="body-text">The homepage serves as the primary interface for investors, presenting a curated list of startups seeking funding. Startups are displayed in a card-based or list format, each featuring key information such as the startup name, industry, funding progress, and a brief description. Investors can easily browse, filter, and search for startups based on categories such as industry, funding stage, or location.</p>
                    <p class="body-text">Each startup card provides a quick overview with the option to tap for more detailed information. Upon selection, users can view comprehensive startup profiles, including founders' details, pitch decks, current investors, and financial projections. The goal is to create a seamless, informative experience that encourages discovery and engagement, while offering startups the opportunity to showcase their potential.</p>
